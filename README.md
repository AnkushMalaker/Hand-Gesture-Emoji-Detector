# Hand-Gesture-Emoji-Detector

A project I have been eaning to try out for a long time but never got the time to. It is a simple hand gesture detection models where instead of gesture labels we get the corresponding emoji. I used over 800 images per gesture which were taken from [Kaggle's Hand Gesture Recognition Database](https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog) . There are definately more than that in the dataset but I chose to work with these many only to get a good enough model. I have used a triple layer convolutional neural network to get an accuracy of 84%.

One of the problems that I couldn't resove was to get the emoji appear on the video frame itself. Feel free to contribute if you can solve that or get a better architecture.
